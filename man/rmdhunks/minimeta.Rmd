A new feature is the creation of a minimal schemaorg.json for insertion on your website's webpage for Search Engine Optimization, 
when the `write_minimeta` argument of `write_codemeta()` is `TRUE`.

You could e.g. use the code below in a chunk in README.Rmd with `results="asis"`.

```r
glue::glue('<script type="application/ld+json">
      {glue::glue_collapse(readLines("schemaorg.json"), sep = "\n")}
    </script>')
```

Refer to [Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs) for more guidance.
