**Why codemetar?** The 'Codemeta' Project defines a 'JSON-LD' format for describing software metadata, as detailed at <https://codemeta.github.io>.
This package provides utilities to **generate, parse, and modify codemeta.jsonld files automatically for R packages**, as well as tools and examples for **working with codemeta json-ld more generally**.

It has three main goals:

- Quickly **generate a valid codemeta.json file from any valid R package**. To do so, we automatically extract as much metadata as possible using the DESCRIPTION file, as well as extracting metadata from other common best-practices such as the presence of Travis and other badges in README, etc.
- Facilitate the addition of further metadata fields into a codemeta.json file, as well as general manipulation of codemeta files.
- Support the ability to crosswalk between terms used in other metadata standards, as identified by the Codemeta Project Community, see <https://codemeta.github.io/crosswalk/>
