# codemetar: generate codemeta metadata for R packages

```{r child='../man/rmdhunks/goals.Rmd'} 
```


## Why create a codemeta.json for your package?

```{r child='../man/rmdhunks/whybother.Rmd'} 
```

## Installation and usage requirements

```{r child='../man/rmdhunks/install-instructions.Rmd'} 
```


```{r child='../man/rmdhunks/internet.Rmd'} 
```

## Create a codemeta.json in one function call

```{r child='../man/rmdhunks/example.Rmd'} 
```

## Keep codemeta.json up-to-date

```{r child='../man/rmdhunks/uptodate.Rmd'} 
```

## A brief intro to common terms we'll use:

- [Linked data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data): We often use different words to mean the same thing. And sometimes the same word to mean different things.  Linked data seeks to address this issue by using [URIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) (i.e. URLs) to make this explicit.

- context: No one likes typing out long URLs all the time.  So instead, the *context* of a JSON-LD file (`"@context"` element) gives us the context for the terms we use, that is, the root URL.  Usually schema.org but domain specific ones also (eg codemeta)

- [Schema.org](http://schema.org): A major initiative led by Google and other search engines to define a simple and widely used context to link data on the web through a catalogue of standard metadata fields

- [The CodeMeta Project](http://codemeta.github.io): an academic led community initiative to formalise the metadata fields included in typical software metadata records and introduce important fields that did not have clear equivalents. The codemeta [crosswalk](https://codemeta.github.io/crosswalk) provides an explicit map between the metadata fields used by a broad range of software repositories, registries and archives

- [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org): While 'linked data' can be represented in many different formats, these have consistently proven a bit tricky to use, either for consumers or developers or both.  JSON-LD provides a simple adaptation of the JSON format, which has proven much more popular with both audiences, that allows it to express (most) linked-data concepts.  It is now the format of choice for expressing linked data by Google and many others.  Any JSON-LD file is valid JSON, and any JSON file can be treated as JSON-LD.  

- [codemetar](https://codemeta.github.io/codemetar): The CodeMeta Project has created tools in several languages to implement the CodeMeta Crosswalk (using JSON-LD) and help extract software metadata into `codemeta.json` records.  `codemetar` is one such tool, focused on R and R packages.

## How to improve your package's codemeta.json?

```{r child='../man/rmdhunks/improvecodemetadata.Rmd'} 
```
